# Future Updates
Theres lots of things to clean up but currently building out the core idea of the project.
Some updates that I want to apply to this project is the following:
- Add a UI via `customtkinter` package (much minimalistic UI)
- Implement google maps directions api (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions)
- Implement google drive api (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk)
    - this will export and save the .csv files to a google drive
